This project contains the code and data for the paper “…” (202..).

:package: It is organised as follow:

-   the `outputs` folder contains high quality PDF files of each Figure
    and Supplementary igure of the paper

-   the `R` folder contains the R scripts used to prepare the basic
    dataframes, compute each plot and diverse values used in the paper.
    Most Figure has one script for preparing data for the plot and
    plotting data and another one for computing interesting values about
    these plots.

-   the `raw_data` folder contains the raw data used in the paper. The
    precise content of each file is described in the following <span
    style="color: aquamarine;">Raw data section</span>.

-   the `transformed_data` folder contains the data build from the
    `raw data files` computed to do the plots. The precise content of
    each file is described in the following <span
    style="color: aquamarine;">Transformed data section</span>.

:sparkles: To get all the figures and analysis of the paper, just run
the `make.R` file
